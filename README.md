#FizBuzz Kata exercise

Write some code that prints out the following for a contiguous range of integer values:

- `Fizz` for numbers that are multiples of 3 or 3
- `Buzz` for numbers that are multiples of 5 or 5
- `FizzBuzz` for numbers that are multiples of 15
- if none of the above is true, just return the integer

e.g. Running the program over a range from 1-20 should output:

    1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz Fizz 7 8 Fizz Buzz 11 Fizz 13 14 FizzBuzz 16 17 Fizz 19 Buzz
